Implement sub AI character that "controls" display, gui units conversion, sensor interpretation, motion integration (future) 
(allows user to choose integration type, duration and precision, which uses different amounts of CPU time). 
This uses CPU time, which in turns uses negligeable amounts of power.
If cpu time is unavailable, some features are turned off (or kept at last value by choice)
